# B-plus-plus
# B++ is a low level language that is a superset of the B language. All valid B code will be able to run in B# upon release as well as many more features that will be implemented. B++ will support typed and typeless programming. B++ will be built as to be a memory safe language with the ability to override the safety through explicit statements.
# We look forward to updating you about B++!
